# personal-website
The home page and _almost_ everything else which is a part of my personal website, http://www.joshoxe.com

# GitHub Link
Instead of manually listing and writing information about projects I've completed, the website uses the GitHub API to automatically pull my public repositories and list them on the website, including information such as date of last commit and the majority language used.
